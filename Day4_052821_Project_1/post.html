            <p class="post-content">Shortly after midnight, a white Nissan Pathfinder pulled up to the El Mula Banquet Hall near Hialeah.</p>
            <p class="post-content">That's when three people "stepped out of the vehicle with assault rifles and handguns and started firing indiscriminately into the crowd," Ramirez said.</p>
            <p class="post-content">"The result is 20 to 25 victims with gunshot injury wounds, and two deceased on the scene."</p>
            <p class="post-content">The wounded were taken to various hospitals in the area. At least one of those hospitalized is in critical condition, police said.</p>
            <p class="post-content">Some of the shooting victims' loved ones wait outside the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami on Sunday.</p>
            <p class="post-content">The banquet hall and billiards club had been rented out for a concert, Ramirez said.</p>
            <p class="post-content">Angelica Green said both her son and her nephew were among those shot.</p>
            <p class="post-content">Her son was shot once in the abdomen area and is in stable condition after surgery, Green said Sunday.</p>
            <p class="post-content">"However, my nephew was shot four times," she said, including once in the abdomen area and three times in the leg.</p>
