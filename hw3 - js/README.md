# Homework 3 JS Assignment - 29 questions

- Implemented both the assignment questions as well as the exercise (custom myReduce prototype function)

## myReduce Function

- Implemetented the custom function and tested it out with different types of array inputs like numbers, strings and a mixture of both.
- Also implemented to take in default values if the initial value is not provided. Worked for the cases that were tested.

## JS Assignment

- Implemented all the solutions mostly using arrow functions and tested all of them using console logs to give the right outputs. Each function test is below the function which is commented out and can be tested.
- I tried implementeing most of them in the most efficient way but a few of them can be improved significanlty which I will be working on next.
- I learnt a lot about the syntax and the different ways a single condition or loop can be implemented. I also used the methods or functions taught in the training like reduce, sort, split, slice etc to implement some of the solutions.
