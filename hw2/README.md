# Homework 2 CSS Assignment

# Layout

- First section is the navbar which consists of unordered lists.
- Second is the top section which ocntains the gray background.
- Third is the main section with the paragraphs of lorem ipsum text.
- Fourth is the footer section similar in style with the navbar component.

# Styles

- Navbar was styled to have multiple unordered lists which will space between themselves to give a uniform look using flex
- The top section has the specified background color with title and paragraph styled as per requirements
- The main section has a row and 3 columns of equal width
  - The row has a 100% width along with correct padding to align with the rest of the page and has a display of flex and content space between to give a uniform look.
  - the columns have padding to separate from each other with specific styles for first and last child to align perfectly with the page.
  - This allows multiple columns to be added and keep the same styles of the page.
- The footer section is styled using the same styles for the navbar with a different background color. Since the navbar has a display of flex and jstify content of space between the two unordered lists are perfectly aligned with the page requirements.
- I was not sure if the fotter had to be at the bottom of the page so an absolute position was given close to the bottom of the page.
- The font styles and font sizes were uniform using the rem feature and variables were given for declaring the colors.
