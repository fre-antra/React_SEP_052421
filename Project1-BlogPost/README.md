# Project 1 Blog Post

## Submission 1 (05/28/2021)

- The project was completed based on the requirements doc and the screenshots provided.
- Both pages were responsive for multiple break points and cgane accordingly to fit to the right screen size. (Small changes needed for about section of the second page.)
- Certain aspects like resuability and scalability were not considered properly so the second submission was mainly focused on improving these areas.
- Based on the screenshots provided, there was an opportunity to add just a single image as a result I did not add multiple images and stuck to the requirements based on the screenshots.

## Submission 2 (05/30/2021)

- As mentioned above, this submission was focused on improving the efficiency of the code written to be more reusable and scalable.
  - The biggest change was implementing variables for the colors so they can be resued and changed at a single folder which makes it easier while changing the colors also while scaling.
  - The next was focusing on the responsive design on the second page (blog page). I added responsiveness in general for the parent divs which affects alll the pages uniformly, but the alignemnt is missing slightlly for the about section in smaller screens. (Focussed on aligning the right column properly under the left column for smaller screens).

* Responsiveness of blog page changes to full width columns usnder a max width of 600px where the right column shifts to the bottom and all the sections occupy 4 column width of the row.
* The button and few other text cpomponents on the header change size as the screen gets smaller.
