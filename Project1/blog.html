          <p>
            Death note is widely known as a Japanese anime that is adapted from
            the manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi
            Obata. The anime and the manga both follow the story of Light Yagami
            who is an exemplary high school student who happens to pick up a
            mysterious notebook that is not from Earth.

            Light quickly discovers that the Death Note is no ordinary notebook
            and can grant it’s owner the power to kill anyone by merely writing
            a person’s name while simultaneously envisioning their face. The
            series continues through Light’s attempts at creating the perfect
            utopian world free of criminals as he kills them off using the Death
            Note.

            He aims to become the God of the new world he wishes to create as a
            vigilante named Kira. His efforts are soon put to the test as L who
            is a brilliant detective conducts an intense investigation in hopes
            of bringing Light to justice. As L and Light play the ultimate cat
            and mouse game, both strategies become more complicated as other
            people start growing involved until Kira (Light Yagami) is
            eventually caught by L’s successors Near and Mello.

          <ol class="blog-list">
            <li>The human whose name is written in this note shall die.</li>
            <li>
              his note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's
              face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people
              sharing the same name will not be affected.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of
              writing the person's name, it will happen.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die
              of a heart attack.
            </li>
            <li>
              After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be
              written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h2>Popular</h2>

            In addition to that, because Death Note is so popular, many people
            have jumped at the opportunity to dissect further answering
            questions such as “How Deadly is the Death Note.” By providing
            realistic calculations as to how many people were killed by the
            death note, and how many killings it would have prevented, we must
            stop to consider the following: have we been wholly dehumanized? Are
            humans just numbers? Do the ends justify the means? If so, are the
            ends even justifiable in the case of the death note or the terms
            death penalty? These are the questions that should be explored and
            will be in the following blog posts.
