                            Students and other people walking around the
                            Georgetown area of Washington, D.C., signed a fake
                            petition ahead of Memorial Day to ban the holiday
                            honoring fallen military service members.

                            The petition, authored by Campus Reform, a
                            conservative news site and higher-education
                            watchdog, calls for support to ban Memorial Day in
                            the U.S. for glorifying "American Imperialism."
                            Campus Reform reporter Addison Smith interviewed
                            those who signed the petition in a video published
                            on the outlet's website.

                            technician Joey Jones told "Fox & Friends Weekend"
                            on Saturday that one of the young men in the video
                            appeared to be about the same age as he was when he
                            fought in his first war.

                            want to," Jones said, making an analogy. "There's a
                            snowman in the movie ‘Frozen,' and he's so stupid
                            and ignorant to the world around him, he can't wait
                            until summer. He sings a whole song about summer,
                            and he's a snowman."

                        <p>Several other people signed the fake petition and told Smith they did not know what the U.S. celebrates Memorial Day.</p>
                        <p>One woman declined to sign the petition because she did not want to have one of her "bank holidays" revoked, adding that the holiday should instead be rebranded as "something else" that celebrates "something worthwhile instead of imperialism."</p>
