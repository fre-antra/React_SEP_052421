React lifecycle
Each component has its lifecycle.
Four stages of its life:
Initialization: where the component is constructed with given Props and state.
Mounting: the component is mounted on the DOM and rendered on the webpage.
componentDidMount(): Invoked right after rendering
updating: When the state is updated. 
componentDidUpdate: Invoked after component's updates and re-rendering on the DOM
Un-mounting: Remove the component from the page.
componentWillUnmount: Invoked before the component is removed from the page.
